# Overview Code Challenges by [**Diego Rios Vasquez**](https://github.com/diegoVasquez600)
Welcome to my Code Challenges repository! Here, you'll find the two coding challenges that showcase my problem-solving and coding skills. Each challenge has its own folder within this repository, and I've also included a video for each challenge where I explain my thought process and how I approached the problem.

## Challenge 1: [EasyChallenge](https://github.com/diegoVasquez600/CodeChallenges_Velozient/tree/main/EasyChallenge)
### Description
In this challenge, I tackled the problem of creating a C# library named TwistedFizzBuzz with multiple functionalities. The library should be capable of handling various FizzBuzz scenarios based on user input, the library should accept user input for ranges, non-sequential sets, alternative tokens and divisors, and API-generated tokens. Additionally, two C# console applications leveraging this library are required: one to solve the standard FizzBuzz problem and another to output customized results for values ranging from -20 to 127 based on specified conditions. The implementation can be found in the [EasyChallenge](https://github.com/diegoVasquez600/CodeChallenges_Velozient/tree/main/EasyChallenge) folder.

### Solution Video
I have provided a detailed video explanation of how I approached and solved this challenge. You can watch the video here.
